# Orbits
Program that simulates planetary orbits

This simulation demonstrates the effect Jupiter has on an asteroid using the Verlet algorithm. It shows that at certain distances from the sun, the orbits of asteroids can be quite unstable, and that is why the asteroid belt is bound to the exact region where we observe it.Â 

**Note:** You can also run this simulation online: https://glowscript.org/#/user/PyCat42/folder/MyPrograms/program/Orbit2
